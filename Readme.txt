This is an example of Delphi controls customisation. It is an TStringGrid Component modified to get these new features:

- Colour mode (Row/Column): Different colour to odd rows or to Price column
- Alignment: Right alignment in Price column
- Hint showed for cells with partially showed text
- ... To indicate that the cell text is partially showed 
- Tick it column (Double click changes state)
- Double click in a row launch edit window
- Txt files can be dragged and dropped in grid from Windows Explorer (You will find two sample txt files in this directory that you can drop in)
- Small bmp files can also be dropped in the grid (It's not permanent. You will find two sample bmp files called Zero.bmp and One.bmp) 
- Customised button with led and OnEnter/OnExit events
